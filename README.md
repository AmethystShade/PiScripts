# PiScripts

Python scripts intended to be used with a Raspberry Pi.

**Most of this PROBABLY WON'T WORK with your own setup.** However, `joycon_test.py` might be useful as an example for getting Joycon inputs.

## Current scripts:

- `joycon_test.py`: displays basic Joycon input, including buttons pressed and data from the left joystick. Requires [joycon-python](https://pypi.org/project/joycon-python/).
